Historically, Caribbean signed languages have received minimal attention compared to spoken languages. Past ideologies and technical challenges in documenting visual languages contributed to this neglect. To the extent that the histories of Caribbean deaf communities have been documented at all, it has been done by hearing people, reported in written languages, inaccessible to most members of Caribbean deaf communities. 

However, recent advancements in video technology have enabled the creation of comprehensive digital collections, capturing the rich linguistic and cultural heritage of Caribbean deaf communities. These recordings contain a wealth of historical narratives from deaf people themselves, expressed in their own languages. This project utilises these collections, drawing from previous and ongoing documentation efforts, to curate an exhibition of Caribbean deaf history.
